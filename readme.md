**2. What is our Team Project** <br>
      [The Algorithm(C-Plus-Plus)](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus)


**3. What can we do for our Project** <br>
- *__As a team__* : After investigating Open Source we found that many algorithms, data structures and functions are not properly working. <br>
So, we can solve the problems and we think that finding the way to solve 
the problem we can learn many codes. 

- *__As a member__* : After solving many unsolved problems as a team, each team member can commit more efficient code. Also, each member can find specific function that not implemented in our Open Source and make new function to commit.
